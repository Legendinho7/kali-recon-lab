# kali-recon-lab
Reconnaissance &amp; scanning lab project using Kali Linux on Apple M4 MacBook (ARM64)
# 🛡️ Kali Recon & Scanning Lab (Apple M4 ARM64 Setup)

This project demonstrates a basic recon and scanning lab setup using Kali Linux running on Apple M4 MacBook Pro (ARM64) via UTM. It includes port scanning, web vulnerability detection, and OSINT tools.

---

## ✅ Why I Built This

As part of my cybersecurity learning path, this lab demonstrates my ability to:
- Use essential tools like Nmap and Nikto
- Set up Kali Linux on Apple Silicon using UTM
- Document and report scan findings

---

## 🖥️ Environment

- **Host:** macOS on Apple M4 Pro (ARM64)
- **VM:** Kali Linux ARM64 ISO
- **Virtualization Tool:** [UTM for macOS](https://mac.getutm.app/)
